# Springfield NJ Times Design Brief

## A brief summary of the business / site goals.
The primary purpose of this site is to give me an excuse to learn web design and development.

The other purpose of this site is to create a virtual community for Springfield, NJ residents and visitors.  This site should provide news and information about all things Springfield at a level of detail that is not generally available from other sources, or at least not available all in one place.  The site should all users to both consume and contribute to information on Springfield, and to engage with each other.

## The key users.
* Me - The site should help me learn web design and web development.  The site should give me practice in authoring web content.  The site should also give me practice in creating and nurturing a community.
* Springfield, NJ residents and others - the site should give information to these users that generally doesn't exist elsewhere (so-called "hyper-local" content, if that's what it's still so-called).  The site should also enable these users to form a community by allowing them to contribute, comment/share/like, and discuss materials.

## Scenarios in which your app or site will be used.
* I will create content for the site, will find existing content elsewhere that might be relevant to this site, and publish all of it in a consumable way here.
* Others will find this content, consume it, and discuss it if desired.

## Design style guidelines to follow.
* Easy to read
* Easy to find
* Welcoming to encourage contributions
